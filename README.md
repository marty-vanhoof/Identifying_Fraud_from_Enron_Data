In this project, I work on building a few different machine learning algorithms in order to identify fraudulent employees in the Enron scandal.  This project comes from Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) course.  It uses Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


The report for the project can be viewed in [jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marty-vanhoof/Identifying_Fraud_from_Enron_Data/blob/master/enron_report.ipynb), or the original jupyter notebook is available [here](enron_report.ipynb).  The project is still a bit of a work in progress.
