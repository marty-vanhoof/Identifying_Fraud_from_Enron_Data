    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Founded in 1985, Enron was one of the world's major electricity, natural gas, communications and pulp and paper companies.  Enron was named \"America's Most Innovative Company\" for six consecutive years by *Fortune* magazine.  Much of this apparent success, though, was due to systematic and elaborate accounting fraud and corruption.  By the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting, they were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects.  By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy, and many executives at Enron would later be indicted and some of them sent to prison.  In the resulting investigation, a large amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record.  This included a large database of emails known as the *Enron Corpus*, and also detailed financial data for top executives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to try to probe this financial and email data using machine learning techniques in order to attempt to identify persons of interest (POI) in the Enron scandal.  POIs are individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.  This report details the following process:\n",

    "We begin by doing some exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order to get a better understanding of the dataset and remove a few outliers.  The Enron email and financial data has been preprocessed and combined into a Python dictionary, where each key-value pair in the dictionary corresponds to one person.  The dictionary key is the person's name, and the value is another dictionary, which contains the names of all the features and their values for that person. \n",
